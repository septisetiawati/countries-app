## Note
This app still need improvement. There is performance issue when dragging item on the large list, because there are more than 200 items on the list. 

### Step 1: Install dependencies
First, install all dependencies of the project. 

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```


### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Then, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
